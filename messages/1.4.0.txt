TypeTodo v1.4.0 important notice:

HTTP database engine is introduced and attempt to become default.
Existing project's configs will remain unchanged.

Default configuration is set to use HTTP database at http://typetodo.com if global  config doesn't exists or is blank.
In this case new public repository will be created and used within all upcoming projects files.
Warning: If you loose that repository key, there can be NO WAY to get it back.

You can access your http repository at http://typetodo.com/repname, where repname is same as in .do config (e.g. /~eif9t7kgahvk)
