Start by typing comment "//todo:" (or use other comment symbols).
It should expand to snippet and then store do database at any change.


By default TypeTodo is configured to store tasks both in .do files located in projects root folder and in HTTP repository at http://typetodo.com/.

TypeTodo's configs are accessible by Sublime commands that are named "TypeTodo:..." in Command Palette.


HTTP repository is accessible by 'TypeTodo: Browse TypeTodo's repository' command.
Its better to register at typetodo.com and use your own named repository.
