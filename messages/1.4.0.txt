TypeTodo v1.4.0 important notice:

HTTP database engine is introduced and become default.

Default database is configured to be HTTP with http://typetodo.com server if global config doesn't exists.
New public repository is created and will be used within all upcoming projects. Existing project's configs will remain unchanged.
HTTP repository is accessable at http://typetodo.com/repname, where repname is same as in .do config (e.g. /~eif9t7kgahvk)

You can locate and reset TypeTodo's configs using provided Sublime commands that are named "TypeTodo:...".

WARNING: If you loose public repository key, there can be NO WAY to get it back.
