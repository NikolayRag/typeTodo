v1.6.4

new:
- Doplet is created as snippets with 3 tabs: Tag, Priority and Comment.
- Restrict doplet editing if selection range is other than Tags, Priority and Comment blocks.
- Added "+/-" shortcut when over Priority to change it

fix:
- Previously Undo was implicitly altered so it took in account every changed character instead of word. This is no more issue.
