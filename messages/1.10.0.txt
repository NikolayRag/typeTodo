v1.10.0

  add:
  - HTTP config accepts explicitly specified 'project' (for new JSON configs).
  - Global config and Project config commands are placed
    into 'Preferences/Package settings' menu.

  change:
  - config is moved to .do.cfg JSON file from *.do file database,
    as it was meant to be at very beginning.
    Migration is performed silently as needed.
  - 'File' runtime maxID stored in single .do.state file.

  remove:
  - Reset Database command considered useless and unsafe. Delete global .do.cfg instead.

  fix:
  - tags sometime failed in SQL
