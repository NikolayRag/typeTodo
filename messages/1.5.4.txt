v1.5.4

new:
- Todo's states expanded and up to grow more
- Added 'Cancel' and 'Progress' states for '!' and '=' prefixes respectively
- Triggering to 'Cancel' state also wipes todo from code, as 'Close' do
- Added SetState command; It duplicates changing states by entering symbol, and mostly added for those who dont want to remember prefixes
- Added <alt+d> binding to SetState command

issues:
- External DB states will now be 'Open' and 'Close' with newly created id's, and state name migration is done at first access to every one project by saving all tasks with +1 version and refering to new id_state. Old names ('True' and 'False') are remained with their id's. So if you're using SQL db, you may want to check id_state reassignment for all tasks within project.
