v1.8.9

new:
- unused database ID is released oh Sublime exit, no more continuos ID incrementing as a result of several Sublime restarts.

fix/change:
- resaving on filename change was performed at wrong time, leading to unwanted tasks resavings. Taking that resaving is not surely needed, it was removed at all.
