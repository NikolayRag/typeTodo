v1.8.1

change:
- 'file' base now holds only last Editor and Timestamp, without Creator and Creation stamp anymore: it is job for sql/http storage.

new:
- 'Search todo' will skip files listed in sublime config
- 'Search todo' will skip files greater than ~500k

fix:
- 'Search todo' by tags now ignores case
- 'Search todo' didnt jump to external 'file'
- set '.do' syntax automatically to all files which are used for 'file' base
