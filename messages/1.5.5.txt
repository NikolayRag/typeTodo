v1.5.5

new:
- Category for one todo can be enumerated by comma and now realised as 'tags'

issues:
- MySql db is affected most by adding 'tag2task' link table; Changes are up to be done automatically, as well as new todo's will be saved in new format. 'tasks'.'id_category' will remain and points to first tag of list.
