v1.3.0

new:
- internal: TodoTask are managed now from TodoDb. Step toward buffered flush and consistency check.
- buffered flush introduced; all changes are flushed after 2 seconds of idle
- as a result of buffered flush, SQL stores full history of TODO changes. No SQL table definitions affected.

fixes:
