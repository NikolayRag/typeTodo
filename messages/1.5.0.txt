TypeTodo v1.5.0 important notice:

'File' mode is now always on. So regardless of configuring remote DB's, all tasks will be stored in .do file.

If additional DB's configured, all of them, including 'File' are synchronized at ST start and other flush points.
Due to implemented synchronizing, Transfer command is removed.

WARNING: Number of external DB that is allowed at the moment is one (1), also it is issue to remove that limitation some day (low priority, but all code is prepaired).
