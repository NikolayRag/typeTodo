v1.7.0

new:
- Doplet highlighting in code. Could slow down if lot of doplets in one file, issue to be fixed.
- Basic consistency check at startup: doplets that are not equal to those in dbase are highlited red. NOTHING is changed in code, its all up to user. '.do' file contain dbase-version of record, so you can hop using (alt+shift+d) to see differense.
  Notice, that any edit of inconsistent doplet will overwrite new version into dbase.
- 'Toggle Colorize' command added which stores it state.

fix:
- Fixed unstable focusing at 'Find todo' command
- Canceling doplets with reason failed. Fixed.
- (alt-d) shortcut more strictly restricted to doplet
- Entering blank reason when calceling leave doplet comment unchanged

change:
- No more deleting line itself when calceling doplet, only content is removed.
