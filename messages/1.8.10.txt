v1.8.10

fix:
- database synchronisation fixed for multidbs: tasks were resaved with same stamp at startup (at least); live-edited db redefinitions now synchronised as well.
- new explicitely defined 'file' database was not created
- reserved ID was wrongly reset when switching all (even if one) databases onfly
- concurrent fetch() and flush() detected and removed
- jumping from search result for duplicated doplets started new search, not issue no more

change:
- reuse id for immediately canceled task
- engines internal error handling reviewed

issue:
- some missynchronisations detected when databases are continuosly added/deleted while changing doplets. But since this plugin was not intended to be heavily synchronising tool, such behavior is accepted.
  No data loss noticed. Anyway everything should be nicely synchronised when all neccessary databases are in place.
