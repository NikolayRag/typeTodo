v1.6.3

new:
- 'Find todo' command added and binded to <alt+shift+d>. It is used to navigate through Todos, acting flexible depending on context:
  * When cursor is at Todo line, then '.do' file is searched for record and it gets focus;
  * When cursor is over Todo in '.do' file, project files are searched for that Todo and it gets focus;
  * If neither, text input is offered to find Todo by its number.
