v1.7.2

changed:
- config moved to class, technical issue, maybe some untested issues dealing with .do

new:
- skipped some known file extentions at 'Find todo' command
- 'Find todo' command accepts '*' as synonim for '.*' tagged search
- (+/-) key shortcuts changed with (shift+plus/minus)
- (shift+plus/minus) key shortcuts as well as 'Set state' command (alt+d) triggers everywhere in doplet
+ set state by pressing corresponding key (alt+shift+[-+=!]) 

fix:
- .do is saved being sorted by ID
- new doplet ID could be not synchronized when more than 1 db was used, fixed.
