v1.5.0

new:
- Multiple DB allowed. Task will be saved to all specified DB's at one time.
- 'File' mode DB is always on and dont have any explicit settings.
- Specified DB's are synchronized at ST start and at flush points.

change:
- 'Transfer' command is obsolete and removed, due to ability to set multiple synchronized DB's.

fix:
- HTTP is now fetched/synchronized.

issue:
- At the moment only one external DB (in addition fo 'File') is allowed; It is defined by last config string, as before. Removing this limitation is low-priority, tho all code preparations are done.
- Synchronizing only last version of each task is desired behaviour from now.
