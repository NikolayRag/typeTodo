TypeTodo important notice:


By default, you should be prompted to setup HTTP database right after install.
If accept so, new HTTP public repository is created at http://typetodo.com and will be used within all upcoming projects until reconfigured.

HTTP repository is accessable at http://typetodo.com/repname, where repname is same as in .do config (e.g. /~eif9t7kgahvk)

You can locate and reset TypeTodo's configs using provided Sublime commands that are named "TypeTodo:..." in Command Palette.


No matter you accept HTTP or not, database is always stored in .do file itself.


WARNING: If you loose public repository key, there can be no way to get it back. Instead, register at typetodo.com and use your own named repository.
