v1.8.1

change:
- 'file' base now holds only last Editor and Timestamp, without Creator and Creation stamp anymore: it is job for sql/http storage.
- save only doplets with actual changes; changing doplet and then undoing will not reset stamp in sql/http
- 'Search todo' will skip files listed in sublime config
- 'Search todo' will skip files greater than ~500k

fix:
- 'Search todo' by tags now ignores case
- 'Search todo' didnt jump to external 'file'
- set '.do' syntax automatically to all files which are used for 'file' base
- 'file' saved only if any of doplets are changed; previous 'file' was saved at any db reset, say at ST unfocus.
- canceling 'Search todo' with blank input (within view) caused jump somewhere; fixed
