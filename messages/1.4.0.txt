v1.4.0

new:
- HTTP engine introduced and become default. http://typetodo.com is used as default server
- HTTP anonymous and registered repositories are supported
- added command to open current project's HTTP repository in browser, if any
- added command to open current project's and global .do config files
- added command to reset global .do config to default.
  That will be HTTP with new public repository.
  Existing global tasks will attempt to move to that new repository
- added command to reset project's .do config.
  New database settings will be copied from global .do,
  and project's tasks will attempt to move to new location.
  
changes:
- verbose and dialog messages changed

fix:
- Strange code preventing SQL table creation is changed to working one.

known issues:
- Global reset and project's transfer will NOT work if original database is HTTP.
  Only File or SQL are supported as source yet.
  Also if transfering from SQL, ONLY LAST task's version will be copied.
- Synchronysing changes from database is still not working. It is the issue of next version.
  Also http://typetodo.com doesn't have any 'modify' tools yet. Be patient.
  

v1.3.1

fixes:
- all changes are flushed at exit (and at changing window)
- as flush-at-exit fixed, flushing delay raised to 5 sec's


v1.3.0

new:
- internal: TodoTask are managed now from TodoDb. Step toward buffered flush and consistency check.
- buffered flush introduced; all changes are flushed after 2 seconds of idle
- as a result of buffered flush, SQL stores full history of TODO changes. No SQL table definitions affected.

fixes:
- idented doplets doesnt seems to be saved as edited; Now they do

known issues:
- (fixed in v1.3.1) changes flushed in 2 seconds of idle, so they will be lost if ST is exited in that time.
