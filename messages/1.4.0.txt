TypeTodo v1.4.0 important notice:

HTTP database engine is introduced and become default.


If global ".do" config not exists, default configuration is set to use HTTP database at http://jobr.c
New public repository will be created and used within all upcoming ".do" files.

Warning: If you loose that repository key, there can be NO WAY to get it back.
You should use http://jobr.c reminder service before that event if you are aware of repository safeness.
