v1.8.2

new:
- 'Update inconsistence' tool for in-view replacing outdated doplets with actual ones
- fetch and synchronize db periodically, not only at start and at .do change
- jump from search results by mouse doubleclick
- 'Search todo' allow exclusive search by prefixing search string with '-': only doplets that are NOT tagged as any of listed tags will match.

fix:
- autocompletion was wasted after doplet's tag
